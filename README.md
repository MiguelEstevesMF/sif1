Information System of Formula 1

SIF1 is an academic project developed in 2009 at University of Minho, PT.
This software program is a Java web application (J2EE and deployable in JBoss) that manages an information system for Formula One races.
For further details on how the application works, see the documentation in the repository (https://github.com/MiguelEstevesMF/sif1/blob/master/relatorio/SIF1.pdf) and try the application in www.sif1.pt.vu.

This application provides a Web management and simulation of Formula 1 races in real-time and is similar to the system already implemented by F1 team.
The code provided in here may be of help for whom is about to develop a similar system and domain logic or just for curious people and afficionados for J2EE, JSF and Icefaces.

Note that the code provided here is ready to work on JBoss 5.1 and using Icefaces 1.8.1 libraries.
Although a port has been made to JBoss 7.1 and is working at www.sif1.pt.vu in Openshift cloud service.
